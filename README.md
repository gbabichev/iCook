<!-- ## 🖥️ Features, Tools, and Settings

### Features

- View current defailt mail app. 
- Set new default mail app. 
- Test default mail app by generating a test .eml file. 


## Why does this exist?

Great question! Here's the thing: macOS has this quirky relationship with .eml files. While you can easily set default apps for .jpg, .pdf, or .mp3 files, Apple makes it very difficult to set a default for .eml. 


## FAQ

**Q: Will this break anything?**  
A: Nope! MacMailPicker only changes .eml file associations.

**Q: What if I want to change my mind later?**  
A: Just run MacMailPicker again and pick a different app.

**Q: Does this work with [insert email app here]?**  
A: If it can open .eml files, MacMailPicker can probably find it and use it.

**Q: Why didn't Apple just fix this?**  
A: Great question! I've been wondering the same thing.  🤷‍♂️
