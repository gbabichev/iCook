    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how this app (“the App”) handles your information.</p>

    <h2>Core Principles</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>iCloud Sync:</strong> All recipes and collections you create are securely synced to your iCloud account. This keeps your recipes up‑to‑date across your Apple devices (iPhone, iPad, Mac).</li>
      <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> Your recipes are encrypted in transit and at rest through iCloud's security infrastructure.</li>
      <li><strong>No collection, no tracking:</strong> We do not collect, transmit, sell, or share personal data beyond iCloud sync. We do not track usage, collect analytics, or access your content directly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What We Don't Do</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We do not collect analytics, usage metrics, crash reports, or identifiers.</li>
      <li>We do not use third‑party SDKs, trackers, or ad networks.</li>
      <li>We do not store data on our own external servers or with third-party services (only with Apple's iCloud, which you control).</li>
      <li>We do not have access to your recipes — they are directly synced from your device to your iCloud account.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Your Choices</h2>
    <p><strong>iCloud Sync:</strong> All recipes you create are synced to your iCloud account to keep them up‑to‑date across your Apple devices.</p>
    <p><strong>Sharing:</strong> If you choose to share a collection, iCloud Sharing is used to invite collaborators. You control who has access and can stop sharing at any time.</p>
    <p><strong>Export:</strong> You can export your data into a readable JSON file using the Mac version of the app.</p>
    <p>Any time you export, copy, or share content using your operating system’s share or file features, that action is under your control.</p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App does not collect personal information from anyone, including children.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>If we make material changes to this policy, we will update the “Last updated” date above and include the revised policy in the app repository or website.</p>
